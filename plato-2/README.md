# PLATO-2: 
**PLATO-2: Towards Building an Open-Domain Chatbot via Curriculum Learning**
https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16779

## Abstract
To build a high-quality open-domain chatbot, we introduce the effective training process of PLATO-2 via curriculum learning. There are two stages involved in the learning process. In the first stage, a coarse-grained generation model is trained to learn response generation under the simplified framework of one-to-one mapping. In the second stage, a fine-grained generation model and an evaluation model are further trained to learn diverse response generation and response coherence estimation, respectively. PLATO-2 was trained on both Chinese and English data, whose effectiveness and superiority are verified through comprehensive evaluations, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
