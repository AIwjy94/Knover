# Knover
Knover is a toolkit for knowledge grounded dialogue generation based on PaddlePaddle. Knover allows researchers and developers to carry out efficient training/inference of large-scale dialogue generation models. 

### What's New:

- July 2020: We are opening [PLATO-2](plato-2/README.md), a large-scale generative model with latent space for open-domain dialogue systems.
